## STAC Sprint #3

Taking place in Menlo Park, CA at USGS, as part of the Satellite Data Interoperability Workshop. 

Goals: 

* Work towards a stable 0.7.0 version of the spec based on resolving differences in existing implementations
* Create new data and software implementations, and align existing ones for full interoperability
    * And use these implementations to flesh out core changes and extensions needed
* Build and advance client libraries and test engines to exercise implementations
