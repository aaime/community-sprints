### Overview

AKA 'level 0', aka 'no code catalog'


To make imagery catalogs as accessible as possible we should have a version that other advanced catalogs can just 'crawl'. 
It should be possible to implement it with no interactive code, not even AWS Lambda. A user should be able to just put core imagery metadata with cloud optimized geotiff's on S3 and set up links to be crawled. 
For example Landsat PDS should be able to implement the spec, without standing up a server. This team should also 
investigate the HTML version of imagery metadata records, to follow [Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/) from WC3 
(which will be more crawlable by search engines). Ideally it's a very trimmed version of the main spec.
