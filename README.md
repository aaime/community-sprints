# Development sprints

## Oct 25 2017 - STAC Development sprint Boulder CO

[10252017-boulder-co]

This repository was used to organize a sprint in boulder that brought together 13 organizations in the general imagery and geospatial domain to collaborate on new standards for searching observed assets. The effort was roughly focused on imagery from satellites, but the goal was to design a core set of search fields that could handle a wider variety of assets - imagery from drones, balloons, etc., point clouds/LiDAR, derived data (like NDVI), mosaics, synthetic aperture radar, hyperspectral, etc.

The resulting specifications are continuing to evolve, in the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog and SpatioTemporal Asset Metadata repositories.

This repository serves as a historical record, so others can see what was discussed and created during the sprint.
