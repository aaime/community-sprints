## Overview

The STAC / OGC API Sprint is taking place November 5-7 in Arlington, VA. 

This folder will evolve to hold the full agenda, tracks and space for experimentation. To start it holds a collection of 
'prep work' so that we can align as much as possible beorehand and hit the ground running.

### Transition
It is important that the work we do in this Sprint has a transition path into standards and implementations. The OGC is developing a process for identifying, maturing, test-driving, and adopting new API modules. The "proposals" subdirectory contains a description of the process (README.md), templates, and a couple examples. Teams are encouraged to use this resource to capture both normative and informative information about what you have developed.
