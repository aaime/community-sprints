## Overview

This document should link to all work happening at the sprint. Links to PR's and proposals

* [Aligned STAC-specific endpoints more with OAF](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/632) - also mentioned in a related [OAF issue](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/issues/154).
* [Franklin](https://github.com/azavea/franklin) work ongoing around filling in OFeat / STAC endpoints and an importer. Endpoint progress is visible in the README, open work is visible in the [PRs](https://github.com/azavea/franklin/pulls)
* [Converted search metadata to context object](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/633) - consolidated search metadata into a context object that the root level of the FeatureCollection. Slimmed down property names.

### Common Query Language

* [Cleaned up BNF from OGC Catalgue](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/blob/master/extensions/cql/schema/cql.bnf)
* [Developed equivalent JSON encoding](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/blob/master/extensions/cql/schema/cql.json)
* [Developed and alternate equivalent JSON encoding of CQL](https://github.com/tschaub/ogcapi-features/blob/json-array-expression/extensions/cql/jfe/readme.md)
* Examples of each can be found [here](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/tree/master/extensions/cql/examples) and [here](https://github.com/tschaub/ogcapi-features/blob/json-array-expression/extensions/cql/jfe/examples.md)
* A filter capabilties document was also developed [here](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/blob/master/extensions/cql/schema/filter-capabilities.json) with an example [here](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/blob/master/extensions/cql/examples/filter-capabilities-example-full.json)
* Trivial point, there is an OGC document number of the CQL extension document: OGC 19-079.

### Transactions

* A detailed outline of the OGC transactions, based on OGC work, was posted [here](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/blob/master/extensions/transactions/TX_Notes.adoc)
